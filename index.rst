Prototype Binary Software Distribution Methods
==============================================

SQuaRE is investigating a number of methods for distributing binary builds of
LSST DM's science pipeline or "application" software. Initial target platforms
are CentOS 6 & 7, with support for OS X planned for as soon as build resources
become available.

We envision producing binary distribution products for official releases,
weekly development releases, and eventually on a nightly basis.  Construction
of a binary product on demand is also a possibility.  Work is underway to fully
automate this process.

Methods being evaluated include:

- OpenStack images on the NCSA Nebula system
- AWS images (AMIs)
- docker containers
- CernVM-FS (see Fabio Hernandez's `lsst-cvmfs`_)
- tarballs of an installed build tree
- "all-in-one" RPMs
- QEMU/KVM images

.. _lsst-cvmfs: https://github.com/airnandez/lsst-cvmfs

Currently Available Formats
---------------------------

In this note, we describe two formats for pre-built binaries:

* :ref:`nebula-images`
* :ref:`docker-containers`
* :ref:`aws-amis`

Desired Feedback
----------------

- Success and/or failure reports -- is anything broken?

- Are there any other binary distribution methods desired by end-users?  Eg.
  Debian/Ubuntu based VM images, containers, packages?

- How do binary products integrate into existing workflows?


Vagrant based demonstration
===========================

`Vagrant`_ is a tool to "Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and
portable development environments." -- in other words, it is essentially a user
friendly interface for spawning and accessing virtual machines.

A demonstration of launching VM instances on the NCSA Nebula OpenStack system
with Vagrant has been created called `vagrant-nebula`_.  The two brief walk
throughs below use this repository.

This simple `vagrant cheat sheet`_ may be useful.

.. _Vagrant: https://vagrantup.com
.. _vagrant-nebula: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vagrant-nebula
.. _vagrant cheat sheet: https://gist.github.com/wpscholar/a49594e2e2b918f4d0c4

Initial Setup
-------------

To follow the examples, we assume that the reader already has a working Nebula
account, and has `Vagrant`_ installed.

* Follow the instructions in :doc:`installing-vagrant`.
* Follow the instructions for `Getting Nebula Credentials`_ and source the
  rc file into your shell's environment.

.. _Getting Nebula Credentials: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vagrant-nebula#getting-nebula-credentials

Now, choose your adventure:

* :ref:`Docker container <vagrant-docker-run>`
* :ref:`Nebula instance <vagrant-nebula-run>`

.. _vagrant-nebula: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vagrant-nebula

.. _vagrant-docker-run:

Running a docker image on top a Nebula instance
-----------------------------------------------

In your local computer's shell, clone and run `vagrant-nebula`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vagrant-nebula.git
    cd vagrant-nebula
    vagrant up el7-docker
    vagrant ssh el7-docker

The last command opened an SSH session to an instance on Nebula. In the
instance's shell, run docker:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker pull lsstsqre/centos:7-stack-lsst_apps-w_2015_45
    docker run -ti lsstsqre/centos:7-stack-lsst_apps-w_2015_45

.. _vagrant-nebula-run:

Running a Nebula instance with a pre-built science binaries
-----------------------------------------------------------

An alternative workflow is to run a pre-built stack on the Nebula instance
itself, rather than in a container.

Starting in your local shell, run `vagrant-nebula`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vagrant-nebula.git
    cd vagrant-nebula
    vagrant up el7
    vagrant ssh el7

Now in the shell of the instance on Nebula, you can access the pre-built stack
at ``/opt/lsst/software/stack``.

Running the "stack" demo
------------------------

From a shell on a VM or inside a running docker container, it is possible to
run the "stack" demonstration repo.

Here we run the demo:

.. code-block:: sh

    source /opt/lsst/software/stack/loadLSST.bash
    curl -L https://github.com/lsst/lsst_dm_stack_demo/archive/11.0.tar.gz | tar xvzf -
    cd lsst_dm_stack_demo-11.0
    setup obs_sdss
    ./bin/demo.sh --small


Releasing Nebula resources
--------------------------

Exit from any containers, shells/ssh sessions, etc. and return to the prompt
from which ``vagrant ssh ...`` was invoked.

Destructive shutdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will terminate the Nebula instance and release the the associated storage.
*This is a destructive operation that destroys all data and is non-reversible.*

.. code-block:: sh

    vagrant destroy -f el7


Preserve instance disk state and shutdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vagrant instances, or "boxes" in Vagrant-speak, which have been ``halt``-ed can be restarted by running ``vagrant up ....``.

.. code-block:: sh

    vagrant halt el7


.. _nebula-images:

OpenStack/Nebula images
=======================

Two images have been published under the LSST project on the NCSA Nebula system.

.. _table-nebula:

.. table:: Available Nebula Images

Docker Containers
=================

Demo docker images have being published via Docker Hub under the
`lsstsqre/centos`_ namespace. Instructions for configuring Docker on CentOS
7 are provided in :doc:`installing-docker`.

.. _lsstsqre/centos: https://hub.docker.com/r/lsstsqre/centos/tags/

.. _aws-ami:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) AMIs
==============================

Public AMIs have be posted in the two most popular [Continental US] AWS
regions. We are assuming that AWS/EC2 users are familiar with how to launch an
instance.  AWS also provides copious documentation.  See `Launching an Instance`_ for a reasonable documentation entry point.

.. _table-aws:
